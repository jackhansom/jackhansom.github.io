This is the first in a series of posts aimed to provide a non-physicist explanation of some concepts I've worked on. In this post, I'll start with the conceptually simplest part of work I did during my thesis: *phonon-assisted frequency stabilization of a single quantum emitter*. I'll try to unpack that title in this post by asking (and hopefully answering) a few questions:
* What is a quantum emitter? Why would you need to stabilize its frequency?
* What's a phonon and how does it help?
* How can this be done?

## What's a quantum emitter?

Maybe write quick post on what a quantum dot is

## What are phonons?

## Summary of paper
