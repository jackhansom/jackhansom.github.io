This is the presentation I gave to the 2015 ASI demo day, summarizing the 6-week project I had undertaken with SCL Elections. The presentation is only five minutes long, so deliberately skips over all technical details of the project to give a high level overview of the project. 

The idea of the project was to use machine learning to predict an individual's personality by using only their facebook likes as features. It was an interesting machine learning problem as it is an extremely sparse feature space (millions of features to deal with, or 2-3 orders of magnitude more features than data points). Another interesting challenge associated with this problem was the trade-off between feature completion (number of people liking a particular page) and the amount of signal associated with that feature: popular pages, such as celebrities' and politicians' pages had a large number of likes but the people liking these (fairly generic) are fairly representative of the population at large. The most important pages (as chosen with an L1-regularized model) tend to have a few thousand likes and represent very specific topics.
